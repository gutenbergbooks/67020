<h2 class="nobreak" id="LIFES_GOLDEN_AGE">LIFE’S GOLDEN AGE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">All</span> the world has shrunk since the Golden
Age of our childhood. Time was longer, and
people were taller then. A wet day was the
depth of despair and the end of all things;
the hours also were longer, and a year from
January to December lapsed slowly by, like
the prehistoric ages. The future seemed to be
bringing a measureless succession of such years
until the gigantic height of grown-up people
would be reached; but life was so long, it
was hardly worth while to think about the
mystery of growing to their height at last.
Our old home has shrunk since those days; the
rooms are smaller and darker; the streets, once
familiar, would be narrower if we could see
them now; the garden has shrunk too; the trees
have been growing down; and the church spire
is stumpy, as if Time had pushed its top lower,
like a shutting telescope. Beyond the home
circle who were part of our existence, the grown-up
people of the Golden Age were a mysterious
race. They cared no more for games or playthings;
though we refused to believe that any
length of years would make us cease to care for
hide-and-seek among the gorse and the billows
of fern, and for the mustering of tin armies or
the acquisition of new toys. Not only were the
grown-up people in a dried-up state of indifference
to games and plays, but they actually
laughed at things that were not in the least
funny. They never cried; they never ran; they
did not ask for pudding twice, though they might
have it; they had learned all possible lessons
long ago, and had managed to remember them
for the rest of their lives, and they knew all
about everything always.</p>

<p>But oh, the green world of those days! Have
the green lanes since wound on through golden
light and moving leaf-shadows? Have the cornfields
been so broad beyond the hedges, such
a sea of warm and breeze-swept yellow ripeness,
flecked all along near the hedge-path with
sparkling blue, and with blazing red poppies?
Have the skies been so far away since, where
the lark sang out of sight, and where, with our
head on the grass, we made upward voyages
among the towering white clouds in the clearness
of breezy summer days? Have the summers
burned the dusty roads so white? And has the
milk been so sweet within sight of the sheds at
a doorway under thatched eaves? Is the noontide
stillness of the hot country, the siesta of
the birds, as deep as it was then? Is the scent
of the honeysuckle as strong, and the smell of
the hay? Are there bright beetles in the hayfield
yet, and are butterflies becoming extinct,
compared with their old numbers? Is it possible
to have hay-battles, now that there seem to be
so many painful stubble-fields to traverse in this
world of ours? Who will give us back the heart-thrill
of our first sight of the mountains? Who
will remind us of the actual refreshment of
wading in the shallow sunny brook, or swinging
over it from ropes tied to white-blossomed
trees? Who will send us another song like
our first hearing of the noise of the great
unresting sea, or another sight like the first
vision of its foam-fringed, sky-bounded, sun-dazzled
waters? When the moon shone on the
water then, one longed to look all night; when
the winter stars were out, there was no pageant
like the heaven of heavens. In that Golden
Age the world might have been created and
called good but yesterday, so new a world it
was. We saw</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">The earth and every common sight</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Apparelled in celestial light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The glory and the freshness of a dream.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the glory and the freshness were in
ourselves. Wordsworth calls it the hour ‘of
splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower.’
Not all the splendour has departed; the sun of
those days and the light of our first love are
still lingering in the sunlight of to-day. George
Eliot tells us how a forest of young golden-brown
oak branches with the light gleaming
through, and with ground-ivy and blue speedwell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">{98}</span>
and white star-flowers below, is more beautiful
to the heart than all the grandeur of tropical
forests, because it holds ‘the subtle inextricable
associations the fleeting hours of our childhood
had left behind them. Our delight in the
sunshine or the deep-bladed grass might be no
more than the faint perception of wearied souls,
if it were not for the sunshine and the grass in
the far-off years which still live in us, and
transform our perception into love.’</p>

<p>A yearning for that Golden Age of life has
come in earnest moments to half the world; the
poets have sighed for it; and one of the sweetest
songs that tell of saddest thought became a
favourite long ago because it told how, in gathering
shells on the beach,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A dream came o’er me like a spell—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I thought I was again a child.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>How, why is childhood called the happiest
time of life? And if it be life’s Golden Age,
why cannot we keep the gold?</p>

<p>The reasons why that period is envied seem
to be these: First, and most subtly underlying
all envy of childhood, is the knowledge that it
is the time when we have our whole life before
us. Often it is not the return of the state
itself that is desired, but its anticipation of a life
which we feel to be swift and short, and of a past
which is irrevocable. Not to be children again,
but to have our chance again, is the wish underlying
most of the yearning. Apart from this,
there are many other reasons. We may place
as the second, the freedom of childhood from
responsibility and care; and next, its freshness
and its habitual joy; and last, but very far from
least, the atmosphere of loving service, kindness,
and tenderness which surrounds that helpless
period. Of course, we are speaking of childhood
under favourable circumstances; no one, except,
perhaps, a dying man, would envy the beginning
of life in extreme poverty or in loveless hardship.</p>

<p>Other reasons there are for looking back
tenderly to that Golden Age: it was the time
when we possessed unconsciously all the spiritual
beauty that we recognise now as the inner charm
of little children. They walk in the paradise of
an unfallen world; their simplicity is their
greatest attraction; their faith and trust in those
that care for and provide for them is absolutely
perfect; without any words, they know that the
home-love will last; without taking thought,
they expect to-morrow to be cared for like to-day.
Lastly, they love much, and from the first love
they receive, their life takes vigour and colour.
They are like young plants straining to the light,
and enriched according to their share of warmth
and sunshine.</p>

<p>But there is to the Golden Age another side.
It is not perfection; it is not entirely happy.
How imperfect it is, all of us know, and the flaws
on the surface are not the saddest; in fact, without
some of these, we should hardly recognise
our human fellow-mortals, or we should doubt
that we knew them well. A great educator in
his day was wont to say that he dreaded receiving
a boy whom the parents presented with pride as
faultless; he dreaded that the faults were within,
ready to break out as childhood disappeared.
But all lovers of children will acknowledge the
manifold imperfection that is a part of their
being; and perhaps we should not love them so
well if it was not craving our sympathetic care.
Again, this Golden Age is not an entirely happy
time. It is true that the outbursts of sobbing are
forgotten sooner than we can forget our sorrows;
but the sobs were real while they lasted. As
George Eliot says, this anguish appears very
trivial to weather-worn mortals, who have to
think about Christmas bills, dead loves, and
broken friendships; but it may be not less bitter,
perhaps it is even more bitter, than later troubles.
‘We can no longer recall the poignancy of that
moment and weep over it, as we do over the
remembered sorrows of five or ten years ago.
Surely, if we could recall that early bitterness and
the dim guesses, the strangely perspectiveless conception
of life that gave the bitterness its intensity,
we should not pooh-pooh the griefs of
children.’</p>

<p>So we have decided that the Golden Age is not
perfect—anything but it! And it is far from
being entirely happy. There is another consideration
to be taken into account—what happiness
we possessed in childhood we did not understand
or value. We had that ‘strangely perspectiveless
view of life’ which prevented us from
enjoying our happiness as we enjoy it now, when
we know its value better, through experience and
through a wider view of the world. The want
of a perspective to their world gives to children’s
grief its intensity; they cannot look beyond;
they cannot understand its passing away. But it
also gives to joys their shallowness; and there are
manifold meanings in the saying, that unless we
have suffered we cannot rejoice. Therefore, in
sighing for life’s Golden Age again, the sigh
means a wish, not for childhood as childhood
is, but for childhood with the added consciousness
and experience of after-years. To
have freedom from care, and to know what a
burden care can be; to have freshness, and to
know what <i>ennui</i> means; to have habitual
joyousness, after learning how anxiety can wear
the spirit out of life; to have love and wisdom
watching over one, as if one was what a child is
to a mother’s heart, ‘the unconscious centre and
poise of the universe;’ and at the same time to
know the worth of such wisdom and love; to
have our life all before us, conscious of what life
is and how short are the years; to find again
the Eden garden, innocent of evil, after having
seen how evil fills the world with misery; to
be simple, after having found out the charm and
the wisdom of simplicity; to have—in a word—not
childhood as it is, but as it would be, if we
with our present knowledge could begin again:—this
is what is wished for. This, too, is the
secret of the sympathetic touch in Gray’s well-known
welcome of the breeze from the school of
his boyhood, that breeze that came from the happy
hills, the fields beloved in vain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I feel the gales that from ye blow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A momentary bliss bestow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As waving fresh their gladsome wing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My weary soul they seem to soothe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And, redolent of joy and youth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To breathe a second spring.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That second spring would be boyhood with
manhood’s knowledge—an impossible existence,
a Golden Age that never was. It was because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">{99}</span>
of the grim troop of passions and diseases
waiting ‘in the vale below,’ that Gray envied
the boyhood that had not yet advanced to meet
the strife and miseries of the world. We call
that Golden Age ‘the happiest time,’ merely by
contrast; we forget its small capacity for happiness,
its shallow understanding of the worth of
those good things that we envy; and we apostrophise
it in poetry and prose, because we are
condemning the after-time as unhappy, without
remembering our increased capacity for happiness.</p>

<p>But if it be impossible to carry back to a
new start in life the experience life has given
us, while we are thinking with a sad fascination
of that Golden Age, and feeling the ‘momentary
bliss’ of recollection, we shall not find it
impossible to reverse our aspirations, and to
combine with later life some part, and perhaps
the best part, of our young life’s treasures. We
yearn for those two things together—the happiness
of the beginning, and the light upon it
from the experience of the end. We cannot go
back; but why should we not gather again and
bring forward with us all that can be brought
from the Golden Age? Then, to some extent,
our aspirations will be satisfied.</p>

<p>Out of that Golden Age all the best things
can be picked up and carried along with us still.
Surely this is some comfort to us wayfarers who
must ‘move on!’ We cannot have life over
again; but it can be made to lengthen in worth
by intensity of purpose, and of working, of
loving. These, and not time, are the true
measure of life. We envy freedom from responsibility;
the child has his tasks as we have ours;
his lesson may be as hard as our duty, and
harder; he is happily resigned to tasks in obedience
to the will of others; our buckling down
to duty will bring us our playtime too. Freshness
comes next. Wordsworth, after mourning
that the glory and the dream were gone, acknowledged
that he could receive from the meanest
flower thoughts too deep for tears; so we
strongly suspect that the glory and the dream
were remaining, and that he saw till the last
the earth ‘apparelled in celestial light.’ The
love of the open-air world of beauty is a great
key to lifelong freshness of soul. Another key
to freshness is the custom of being easily pleased.
The smallest gift pleases a child; in later life,
we look more at the love of the giver than at
the gift; but why should not the manifold
growth of small kindnesses refresh us? And
how shall we get habitual joy? It is a precious
treasure; the home is rich where there is one
member of the household brimful of sunshine.
A merry word at home is magic for brightening
life; and it is some encouragement to know
that of all social virtues, the habit of joyousness
is the one that grows fastest by patient effort.
It fosters another childlike treasure—the sense
of delight in a home atmosphere of love. Let
us not fear to express our tenderness in word
and deed for those who share life’s burdens with
us, and the glow of the Golden Age will be
round the hearth again. As for simplicity, it
is already the lifelong dower of many of the
most gifted minds; it is almost a characteristic
of the intellectual men of noblest life. Why
should we use long words when short ones are
kinder; why go roundabout ways when we only
need openly do our best? Wonderful as it may
seem, simplicity is the most imitable part of
childhood. The absence of self-consciousness is
the grand key to it. If we cease thinking about
the effect produced upon others, who are supposed
to have concentrated their attention upon
our puny selves, we shall escape much heart-burning,
and gradually begin to brighten our
path with something of childhood’s brightness.
As for faith and trust, if they look higher than
the roof of home, why should they not be as
the child’s huge trust? We should have fewer
careworn looks, and the habit of joy would be
easier.</p>

<p>There is another quality that must crown this
development of the childlike character—it is
sympathy—that wide and warm sympathy which
knows no growing old, and which is the fruition
of our childhood’s eager freshness. Best of all,
in picking up those old treasures that we carelessly
dropped by the way when the Golden
Age was ending, we may yet be, all unconsciously,
very near the paradise-garden where
once we walked, not knowing our good-fortune,
and but half able to enjoy it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a few minutes, they stood looking blankly
at one another in mute astonishment, turning
over and comparing the two telegrams together
with undecided minds; then at last Nora broke
the silence. ‘I tell you what it is,’ she said,
with an air of profound wisdom; ‘they must
have got an epidemic of yellow fever over in
Trinidad—they’re always having it, you know,
and nobody minds it, unless of course they die
of it, and even then I daresay they don’t think
much about it. But papa and Mr Hawthorn
must be afraid that if we come out now, fresh
from England, we may all of us get it.’</p>

<p>Edward looked once more at the telegrams
very dubiously. ‘I don’t think that’ll do, Miss
Dupuy,’ he said, after re-reading them with a
legal scrutiny. ‘You see, your father says:
“On no account go on board the <i>Severn</i>.” Evidently,
it’s this particular ship he has an
objection to; and perhaps my father’s objection
may be exactly the same. It’s very singular—very
mysterious!’</p>

<p>‘Do you think,’ Marian suggested, ‘there can
be anything wrong with the vessel or the
machinery? You know, they <i>do</i> say, Edward,
that some ship-owners send ships to sea that
aren’t at all safe or seaworthy. I read such a
dreadful article about it a little while ago in
one of the papers. Perhaps they think the
<i>Severn</i> may go to the bottom.’</p>

<p>‘Or else that there’s dynamite on board,’ Nora
put in; ‘or a clockwork thing like the one
somebody was going to blow up that steamer
with at Hamburg, once, you remember! Oh,
my dear, the bare idea of it makes me quite
shudder! Fancy being blown out of your berth,
at dead of night, into the nasty cold stormy
water, and having a shark bite you in two across
the waist before you were really well awake,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">{100}</span>
and had begun properly to realise the situation!’</p>

<p>‘Not very likely, either of them,’ Edward said.
‘This is a new ship, one of the very best on
the line, and perfectly safe, except of course in
a hurricane, when anything on earth is liable
to go down; so that can’t possibly be Mr
Dupuy’s objection to the <i>Severn</i>.—And as to the
clockwork, you know, Nora, the people who
put those things on board steamers, if there are
any, don’t telegraph out to give warning beforehand
to the friends of passengers on the other
side of the Atlantic. No; for my part, I can’t
at all understand it. It’s a perfect mystery to
me, and I give it up entirely.’</p>

<p>‘Well, what do you mean to do, dear?’
Marian asked anxiously. ‘Go back at once, or
go on in spite of it?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t think there’s any choice left us now,
darling. The ship’s fairly under weigh, you see;
and nothing on earth would induce them to
stop her, once she’s started, till we get to
Trinidad, or at least to St Thomas.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t mean to say, Mr Hawthorn,’ Nora
cried piteously, ‘they’ll carry us on now to the
end of the journey, whether we want to stop
or whether we don’t?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I do, Miss Dupuy. They will, most
certainly. I suspect they’ve got no voice themselves
in the matter. A mail-steamer is under
contract to sail from a given port on a given
day, and not to stop for anything on earth,
except fire or stress of weather, till she lands
the mails safely on the other side, according to
agreement.’</p>

<p>‘Well, that’s a blessing anyhow!’ Nora said
resignedly; ‘because, if so, it saves us the trouble
of thinking anything more about the matter;
and papa can’t be angry with me for having
sailed, if the captain refuses to send us back,
now we’ve once fairly started. Indeed, for my
part, I’m very glad of it, to tell you the truth,
because it would have been such a horrid nuisance
to have to go on shore again and unpack all
one’s things just for a fortnight, after all the
fuss and hurry we’ve had already about getting
them finished. What a pity the bothering old
telegrams came at all to keep us in suspense the
whole way over!’</p>

<p>‘But suppose there <i>is</i> some dynamite on board,’
Marian suggested timidly. ‘Don’t you think,
Edward, you’d better go and ask the captain?’</p>

<p>‘I’ll go and ask the captain, by all means,
if that’s any relief to you,’ Edward answered;
‘but I don’t think it likely he can throw any
particular light of his own upon the reason of
the telegrams.’</p>

<p>The captain, being shortly found on the bridge,
came down at his leisure and inspected the messages;
hummed and hawed a little dubiously;
smiled to himself with much good-humour; said
it was a confoundedly odd coincidence; and
looked somehow as though he saw the meaning
of the two telegrams at once, but wasn’t anxious
to impart his knowledge to any inquiring third
party. ‘Yellow fever!’ he said, shrugging his
shoulders sailor-wise, when Edward mentioned
Nora’s first suggestion. ‘No, no; don’t you
believe it. ’Tain’t yellow fever. Why, nobody
who lives in the West Indies ever thinks anything
of that, bless you. Besides, <i>you</i> wouldn’t
get it; don’t you trouble your head about it.
You ain’t the sort or the build to get it. Men
of your temperament never do ketch yellow fever—it
don’t affect ’em. No, no; it ain’t that, you
take my word for it.’</p>

<p>Marian gently hinted at unseaworthiness;
but at this the good captain laughed quite
unceremoniously. ‘Go down!’ he cried—‘go
down, indeed! I’d like to see the hurricane
that’d send the <i>Severn</i> spinning to the
bottom. No, no; we may get hurricanes, of
course—though this isn’t the month for them.
The rhyme says: “June—too soon; July—stand
by; Au-gust—you must; September—remember;
October—all over.” Still, in the course of nature
we’re likely enough to have some ugly weather—a
capful of wind or so, I mean—nothing to
speak of, for a ship of her tonnage. But I’ll
bet you a bottle of champagne the hurricane’s
not alive that’ll ever send the <i>Severn</i> to the
bottom, and I’ll pay it you (if I lose) at the
first port the lifeboat puts into after the accident.—Dynamite!
clockwork! that’s all gammon,
my dear ma’am, that is! The ship’s as good
a ship as ever sailed the Bay o’ Biscay, and
there’s nothing aboard her more explosive than
the bottle of champagne I hope you’ll drink
this evening for dinner.’</p>

<p>‘Then we can’t be put out?’ Nora asked, with
her most beseeching smile.</p>

<p>‘My dear lady, not if I knew you were the
Queen of England. Once we’re off, we’re off
in earnest, and nothing on earth can ever stop
us till we get safely across to St Thomas—the
hand of God, the perils of the sea, and the Queen’s
enemies alone excepted,’ the captain added, quoting
with a smile the stereotyped formula of the
bills of lading.</p>

<p>‘What do you think the telegram means, then?’
Nora asked again, a little relieved by this confident
assurance.</p>

<p>The captain once more hummed and hawed,
and bit his nails, and looked very awkward.
‘Well,’ he said slowly, after a minute’s internal
debate, ‘perhaps—perhaps the niggers over yonder
may be getting troublesome, you know; and
your family may think it an inopportune time
for you or Mr and Mrs Hawthorn to visit the
colony.—All right, Jones, I’m coming in a minute.—You
must excuse me, ladies. In sight of land,
a cap’n ought always to be at his post on the
bridge. See you at dinner.—Good-morning, good-morning.’</p>

<p>‘It seems to me, Edward,’ Marian said, as he
retreated opportunely, ‘the captain knows a good
deal more about it than he wants to tell us.
He was trying to hide something from us; I’m
quite sure he was.—Aren’t you, Nora? I do
hope there’s nothing wrong with the steamer
or the machinery!’</p>

<p>‘I didn’t notice anything peculiar about him
myself,’ Edward answered, with a little hesitation.
‘However, it’s certainly very singular.
But as we’ve got to go on, we may as well
go on as confidently as possible, and think as
little as we can about it. The mystery will all
be cleared up as soon as we get across to
Trinidad.’</p>

<p>‘If we ever get there!’ Nora said, half-jesting,
and half in earnest.</p>

<p>As she spoke, Dr Whitaker the mulatto passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">{101}</span>
close by, pacing up and down the quarter-deck
for exercise, to get his sea-legs; and as he passed
her, he turned his eyes once more mutely upon
her with that rapid, timid, quickly shifting glance,
the exact opposite of a stare, which yet speaks
more certainly than anything else can do an
instinctive admiration. Nora’s face flushed again,
at least as much with annoyance as with self-consciousness.
‘That horrid man!’ she cried
petulantly, with a little angry dash of her hand,
almost before he was well out of earshot. ‘How
on earth can he have the impertinence to go
and look at me in that way, I wonder!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t, dear!’ Marian whispered, genuinely
alarmed lest the mulatto should overhear her.
‘You oughtn’t to speak like that, you know.
Of course one feels at once a sort of natural
shrinking from black people—one can’t help that,
I know—it seems to be innate in one. But
one oughtn’t to let them see it themselves at
any rate. Respect their feelings, Nora, do, dear,
for my sake, I beg of you.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, it’s all very well for you, Marian,’ Nora
answered, quite aloud, and strumming on the
deck with her parasol; ‘but for my part, you
know, if there’s anything on earth that I can’t
endure, it’s a brown man.’</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p>All the way across to St Thomas, endless speculations
as to the meaning of the two mysterious
telegrams afforded the three passengers chiefly
concerned an unusual fund of conversation and
plot-interest for an entire voyage. Still, after
a while the subject palled a little; and on
the second evening out, in calm and beautiful
summer twilight weather, they were all sitting
in their own folding-chairs on the after-deck,
positively free from any doubts or guesses upon
the important question, and solely engaged in
making the acquaintance of their fellow-passengers.
By-and-by, as the shades began to close
in, there was a little sound of persuasive language—as
when one asks a young lady to sing—at
the stern end of the swiftly moving vessel;
and then, in a few minutes, somebody in the
dusk took a small violin out of a wooden case
and began to play a piece of Spohr’s. The ladies
turned around their chairs to face the musician,
and listened carelessly as he went through the
preliminary scraping and twanging which seems
to be inseparable from the very nature of the
violin as an instrument. Presently, having tightened
the pegs to his own perfect satisfaction, the
player began to draw his bow rapidly and surely
across the strings with the unerring confidence
of a practised performer. In two minutes, the
hum of conversation had ceased on deck, and
all the little world of the <i>Severn</i> was bending
forward its head eagerly to catch the liquid
notes that floated with such delicious clearness
upon the quiet breathless evening air. Instinctively
everybody recognised at once the obvious
fact that the man in the stern to whom they
were all listening was an accomplished and
admirable violin-player.</p>

<p>Just at first, the thing that Marian and Nora
noticed most in the stranger’s playing was his
extraordinary brilliancy and certainty of execution.
He was a perfect master of the <i>technique</i>
of his instrument, that was evident. But after
a few minutes more, they began to perceive
that he was something much more than merely
that; he played not only with consummate
skill, but also with infinite grace, insight, and
tenderness. As they listened, they could feel
the man outpouring his whole soul in the
exquisite modulations of his passionate music:
it was not any cold, well-drilled, mechanical
accuracy of touch alone; it was the loving
hand of a born musician, wholly in harmony
with the master he interpreted, the work he
realised, and the strings on which he gave it
vocal utterance. As he finished the piece, Edward
whispered in a hushed voice to Nora: ‘He plays
beautifully.’ And Nora answered, with a sudden
burst of womanly enthusiasm: ‘More than beautifully—exquisitely,
divinely.’</p>

<p>‘You’ll sing us something, won’t you?’—‘Oh,
do sing us something!’—‘Monsieur will not
refuse us!’—‘Ah, señor, it is such a great pleasure.’
So a little babel of two or three languages
urged at once upon the unknown figure silhouetted
dark at the stern of the steamer against the
paling sunset; and after a short pause, the unknown
figure complied graciously, bowing its
acknowledgments to the surrounding company,
and burst out into a song in a glorious rich
tenor voice, almost the finest Nora and Marian
had ever listened to.</p>

<p>‘English!’ Nora whispered in a soft tone, as
the first few words fell upon their ears distinctly,
uttered without any mouthing in a plain
unmistakable native tone. ‘I’m quite surprised
at it! I made up my mind, from the intense
sort of way he played the violin, that he must
be a Spaniard or an Italian, or at least a South
American. English people seldom play with all
that depth and earnestness and fervour.’</p>

<p>‘Hush, hush!’ Marian answered under her
breath. ‘Don’t talk while he’s singing, please,
Nora—it’s too delicious.’</p>

<p>They listened till the song was quite finished,
and the last echo of that magnificent voice had
died away upon the surface of the still, moonlit
waters; and then Nora said eagerly to Edward:
‘Oh, do find out who he is, Mr Hawthorn!
Do go and get to know him! I want so to be
introduced to him! What a glorious singer!
and what a splendid violinist! I never in my
life heard anything lovelier, even at the opera.’</p>

<p>Edward smiled, and dived at once into the
little crowd at the end of the quarter-deck, in
search of the unknown and nameless musician.
Nora waited impatiently in her seat to see who
the mysterious personage could be. In a few
seconds, Edward came back again, bringing with
him the admired performer. ‘Miss Dupuy was
so very anxious to make your acquaintance,’
he said, as he drew the supposed stranger forward,
‘on the strength of your beautiful playing
and singing.—You see, Miss Dupuy, it’s a fellow-passenger
to whom we’ve already introduced
ourselves—Dr Whitaker!’</p>

<p>Nora drew back almost imperceptibly at this
sudden revelation. In the dusk and from a
little distance, she had not recognised their
acquaintance of yesterday. But it was indeed
the mulatto doctor. However, now she was fairly
trapped; and having thus let herself in for the
young man’s society for that particular evening,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">{102}</span>
she had good sense and good feeling enough not
to let him see, at least too obtrusively, that she
did not desire the pleasure of his further acquaintance.
To be sure, she spoke as little and as
coldly as she could to him, in such ordinary
phrases of polite admiration as she felt were
called for under these painful circumstances; but
she tried to temper her enthusiasm down to the
proper point of chilliness for a clever and well-taught
mulatto fiddler.—He had been a ‘marvellous
violinist’ in her own mind five minutes
before; but as he turned out to be of brown
blood, she felt now that ‘clever fiddler’ was quite
good enough for the altered occasion.</p>

<p>Dr Whitaker, however, remained in happy
unconsciousness of Nora’s sudden change of attitude.
He drew over a camp-stool from near the
gunwale and seated himself upon it just in
front of the little group in their folding ship-chairs.
‘I’m so glad you liked my playing,
Miss Dupuy,’ he said quietly, turning towards
Nora. ‘Music always sounds at its best on the
water in the evening. And that’s such a lovely
piece—my pet piece—so much feeling and pathos
and delicate melody in it. Not like most of
Spohr: a very unusual work for him; he’s so
often wanting, you know, in the sense of
melody.’</p>

<p>‘You play charmingly,’ Nora answered, in a
languid chilly voice. ‘Your song and your playing
have given us a great treat, I’m sure, Dr
Whitaker.’</p>

<p>‘Where have you studied?’ Marian asked
hastily, feeling that Nora was not showing so
deep an interest in the subject as was naturally
expected of her. ‘Have you taken lessons in
Germany or Italy?’</p>

<p>‘A few,’ the mulatto doctor replied with a
little sigh, ‘though not so many as I could have
wished. My great ambition would have been to
study regularly at the Conservatoire. But I
never could gratify my wish in that respect,
and I learned most of my fiddling by myself at
Edinburgh.’</p>

<p>‘You’re an Edinburgh University man, I
suppose?’ Edward put in.</p>

<p>‘Yes, an Edinburgh University man. The
medical course there, you know, attracts so many
men who would like better, in other respects, to
go to one of the English universities.—You’re
Cambridge yourself, I think, Mr Hawthorn, aren’t
you?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Cambridge.’</p>

<p>The mulatto sighed again. ‘A lovely place!’
he said—‘a most delicious place, Cambridge. I
spent a charming week there once myself. The
calm repose of those grand old avenues behind
John’s and Trinity delighted me immensely.—A
place to sit in and compose symphonies, Mrs
Hawthorn. Nothing that I’ve seen in England
so greatly impressed me with the idea of the
grand antiquity of the country—the vast historical
background of civilisation, century behind
century, and generation behind generation—as that
beautiful mingled picture of venerable elms, and
mouldering architecture, and close-cropped greensward
at the backs of the colleges. The very
grass had a wonderful look of antique culture.
I asked the gardener in one of the courts of
Trinity how they ever got such velvety carpets
for their smooth quadrangles, and the answer the
fellow gave me was itself redolent of the traditions
of the place. “We rolls ’em and mows ’em,
sir,” he said, “and we mows ’em and rolls ’em,
for a thousand years.”’</p>

<p>‘What a pity you couldn’t have stopped there
and composed symphonies, as you liked it so
much,’ Nora remarked, with hardly concealed
sarcasm—‘only then, of course, we shouldn’t have
had the pleasure of hearing you play your violin
so beautifully on the <i>Severn</i> this evening.’</p>

<p>Dr Whitaker looked up at her quickly with
a piercing look. ‘Yes,’ he replied; ‘it <i>is</i> a pity,
for I should have dearly loved it. I’m bound
up in music, almost; it’s one of my two great
passions. But I had more than one reason for
feeling that I ought, if possible, to go back to
Trinidad. The first is, that I think every West
Indian, and especially every man of my colour’—he
said it out quite naturally, simply, and
unaffectedly, without pausing or hesitating—‘who
has been to Europe for his education, owes it
to his country to come back again, and do his
best in raising its social, intellectual, and artistic
level.’</p>

<p>‘I’m very glad to hear you say so,’ Edward
replied. ‘I think so myself too, and I’m pleased
to find you agree with me in the matter.—And
your second reason?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I thought my colour might stand in
my way in practice in England—very naturally,
I’m not surprised at it; while in Trinidad I
might be able to do a great deal of good and
find a great many patients amongst my own
people.’</p>

<p>‘But I’m afraid they won’t be able to pay you,
you know,’ Nora interposed. ‘The poor black
people always expect to be doctored for nothing.’</p>

<p>Dr Whitaker turned upon her a puzzled pair
of simple, honest, open eyes, whose curious glance
of mute inquiry could be easily observed even
in the dim moonlight. ‘I don’t think of practising
for money,’ he said simply, as if it were
the most ordinary statement in the world. ‘My
father has happily means enough to enable me
to live without the necessity for earning a livelihood.
I want to be of some use in my generation,
and to help my own people, if possible,
to rise a little in the scale of humanity. I shall
practise gratuitously among the poorest negroes,
and do what I can to raise and better their
unhappy condition.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="UNCONDITIONAL_SURRENDER_GRANT">‘UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER’ GRANT.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> 27th of April 1822 was a great day in
Point Pleasant, a little pioneer settlement on
the banks of the Ohio; for Jesse Grant’s wife
presented him that day with a boy, and newcomers
were rare in the little place. Every
detail about the latest arrival was eagerly and
quickly circulated; and if the men of the little
town had learned in some mysterious way what
Jesse Grant’s boy was afterwards to become, they
could hardly have made more stir about him.
But Jesse and his wife could not hit upon a name
for their firstborn, and six weeks after his birth
his only name was ‘Baby.’ A family council was
held to settle the knotty question, and it was
decided to ballot for a name! Each person
present wrote the name he or she favoured on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">{103}</span>
a slip of paper, and the slips were shaken up in a
hat. The first drawn slip was to name the boy,
and as it bore the name Ulysses, Ulysses was
fixed on. But the ballot was not allowed to rule
supreme, for the name of an honoured ancestor
was added to the choice of the ballot; and the
future President of the United States, and general
of its armies, was christened as Hiram Ulysses
Grant, a name that he lost by an accident in after-years.</p>

<p>Jesse Grant was a man of many parts, and not
only conducted a tannery, but also—to quote Mr
Thayer’s description of him in the interesting
life of General Grant, to which we are indebted
for the following incidents of his career (<i>From
Tanyard to White House</i>, by W. M. Thayer.
London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1885)—‘In addition
to tanning, he ran a slaughter-house, did
something at teaming, and occasionally erected a
building for other parties.’ In a house where so
many irons were in the fire, it will readily be
understood there were no idlers, and Ulysses had
early to take his share of the work. A passionate
love of horses, that time only strengthened, was
the outcome of his early acquaintance with them.
At school he was famed only for a wonderful
gift for mathematics, and a stern obstinacy that
often carried him through a task in which a
cleverer boy failed. One day a schoolmate
declared of Grant, when a peculiarly difficult
problem was under discussion: ‘His forte is in
arithmetic, and he will dig away until he has got
it; but I can’t do it!’—‘<i>Can’t!</i> can’t!’ responded
Grant quizzically. ‘What does that mean?’
And away he rushed to the teacher’s desk to
examine the dictionary. The boys looked on
silently, awaiting to see what was afoot. ‘Can’t!’
exclaimed Ulysses; ‘there’s no such word in the
dictionary,’ as he closed the volume. ‘It <i>can</i> be
done.’</p>

<p>There was little in this obstinate determined
youngster to foreshadow his great future, and it
was with no small astonishment that his neighbours
heard a phrenologist’s verdict on the lad.
Let Mr Thayer tell the story: ‘After the lecturer
had been blindfolded, a gentleman set Ulysses in
the chair. The lecturer proceeded to examine his
head, and continued so long without saying a
word, that a citizen inquired “Do you discover
any special ability for mathematics in that boy’s
head?”—“Mathematics!” retorted the lecturer,
as if that kind of ability did not cover the case.
“You need not be surprised if this boy is President
of the United States some day!”’ How far
this judgment accorded with that of the audience,
we may gather from Mr Thayer’s naive comment,
that ‘it did not increase the reputation of the
phrenologist in Mount Pleasant.’</p>

<p>Young Grant’s love of horses was a great hindrance
to his progress at school. Ever more ready
to go afield with the teams than to take his place
in class, it is little wonder that, with the many
opportunities for indulging his propensities which
his father’s business afforded him, he did not
achieve any marked success. As a child of seven
he harnessed a young colt that had never before
been harnessed, though, from his diminutive
stature, he had to stand on an inverted corn-measure
to fix the bridle. At nine, he astonished
his father by asking if he might buy a horse—to
be his own. He had saved enough money to buy
a colt, and was anxious to have one. ‘But there
is risk in buying a horse,’ his father reminded
him. ‘And I am willing to take the risk, father.’
And he did—and from that day was never
without a horse. This willingness to take risks
was a keynote of Grant’s character, and many of
his after-successes were due to it.</p>

<p>Schooldays over, Ulysses served for a while in
his father’s tanyard; but he took a violent
aversion to the business, and an equally strong
craving for ‘an education.’ It was probably this
desire for education, rather than any keen thirst
for military life or glory, that caused him to seek
admission to West Point—the Sandhurst of the
United States—where a good general education
was added to the necessary military course at
little or no cost to the student. Each Congressional
district was entitled to one student in the
college, and application for the vacant cadetship
of their district was made to their member by
Jesse Grant on behalf of his son. The busy man
made inquiries, and then, without referring to
the father’s letter, claimed the appointment for
‘Ulysses Simpson Grant;’ and in this name
Ulysses entered, and thus lost by accident the
name he had gained by ballot.</p>

<p>On entering West Point, each student was
required to deposit sixty dollars to guarantee the
expenses of his return home, in the event of his
failing to pass the entrance examination. Ulysses
broke his journey to spend a short time with
some relatives in Philadelphia before proceeding
to West Point. City life so charmed him that
when his visit came to an end and he was due
at the college, nearly all his money—including
his sixty dollars—was gone. Nothing daunted,
Ulysses presented himself for admission, and met
the demand for his deposit with the calm reply:
‘I intend to pass the examination!’ He was
allowed to sit, and passed easily, and in due
course was graduated as second lieutenant in
1843.</p>

<p>His first appointment was at Jefferson Barracks,
near St Louis. Here it was that he met his future
wife, wooed and, in spite of the opposition of her
parents, who thought their daughter might look
higher than the poor second lieutenant, won her.
The Mexican war gave Lieutenant Grant his first
taste of warfare. Several times he was mentioned
in the despatches for distinguished services; and
for bravery he was appointed First Lieutenant.
Congress proposed to confirm the temporary rank,
but he declined, preferring, he said, ‘to reach the
position by regular gradations of service.’</p>

<p>In 1848, Grant, now Captain, and an honoured
hero of the Mexican war, married. Six happy
years were spent with his regiment, and then, in
1854, he resigned his position, to take to farming.
‘Whoever hears of me in ten years’ time,’ he told
a comrade, ‘will hear of a well-to-do old Missouri
farmer.’ But in ten years’ time he was Commander-in-chief
of the United States armies!
The farming did not pay; a partnership in a
land agency that succeeded it, did little better;
and then the Captain joined his brothers in a
leather business at Galena, Illinois. It was here
that the news of the assault on his country’s flag
by the rebels reached him.</p>

<p>The Confederates had attacked Fort Sumner on
April 12, 1861, and from end to end of the land,
the heart of the loyal States was stirred by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">{104}</span>
tidings. Grant was no politician; indeed, he
disliked and shunned party strife; but he felt in
this news of his country’s danger, the call of
duty. ‘I left the army expecting never to return,’
he said. ‘I am no seeker for position; but the
country which educated me is in sore peril, and
as a man of honour, I feel bound to offer my
services for whatever they are worth.’ Accordingly,
he volunteered; but in the crowd of place-hunters
at the State capital, the retiring, self-distrustful
Captain was passed by. All the
Illinois regiments were provided with commanders,
and in despair of obtaining any appointment,
Grant had actually left the capital to visit
his father, when he received a telegram from the
governor of the State: ‘You are this day
appointed Colonel of the Twenty-first Illinois
Volunteers, and requested to take command at
once.’ The former commander of the regiment
had been dismissed for incompetency, and the
governor had asked one of Grant’s friends, ‘What
kind of man is this Captain Grant? Though
anxious to serve, he seems reluctant to take any
high position. He even declined my offer to
recommend him to Washington for a brigadier-generalship,
saying he didn’t want office till he
had earned it. What <i>does</i> he want?’ ‘The way
to deal with him,’ was the reply, ‘is to ask him
no questions, but simply order him to duty. He
will promptly obey.’ This man knew Grant!</p>

<p>Well might governor Yates exclaim, as he is
reported to have done in after-years: ‘It was
the most glorious day of my life when I signed
Grant’s commission.’ For, as Mr Thayer well
puts it, ‘Grant had found his place. From that
he would go forth “from conquering to conquer.”’
Two months later, he was Brigadier-general—this
time he felt he had <i>earned</i> the post—and
from this point his advance was rapid. Before
the end of the war, the disused ranks of Lieutenant-general,
and General, of the United States
army were revived and conferred on him.
Through the mazes of that long struggle we
need not follow him, but incident after incident
of that awful war show the grand simplicity
and true nobility of his nature. As a commander,
determined to the point of obstinacy,
resolute of purpose, and daring in action—in
private, modest, retiring almost to a fault, and
living a sober, upright life, against which inveterate
foes could bring no charge but the
most groundless tissue of calumnies—all this
was ‘Unconditional Surrender’ Grant.</p>

<p>The very title was characteristic of the man—‘Unconditional
Surrender’ Grant! It arose
from the closing scene of the attack on Fort
Donelson. The Confederate General Buckner
asked for terms, and Grant thus replied to the
demand: ‘Yours of this date proposing armistice,
and appointment of Commissioners to settle
terms of capitulation, is just received. No terms
except an unconditional and immediate surrender
can be accepted. I propose to move immediately
on your works.’ Buckner surrendered.</p>

<p>This stern determination, though perhaps the
ruling feature of Grant’s character, did not shut
out other noble qualities. Before Vicksburg, he
found that his men faltered in the spade-work
under the heavy fire. The General took a seat
near them amid a very hail of shot, and quickly
reassured them by calmly whittling a stick
through it all! At another time, when a battle
was in progress, the General sent one of his staff
on some errand; the officer asked Grant where
he should find him on his return. The answer
showed the stuff the general was made of:
‘Probably at headquarters. If you don’t, come
to the front, wherever you hear the heaviest
firing!’</p>

<p>‘When do you expect to take Vicksburg?’ a
rebel woman tauntingly asked the General. ‘I
can’t tell exactly,’ was the calm reply; ‘but I
shall stay until I do, if it takes thirty years.’
And take it he did, as all the world knows.
There is a singular likeness in this reply to
the ‘unconditional surrender’ of Fort Donelson,
and to the still more famous declaration before
Richmond, after six consecutive days’ fighting,
unparalleled in modern times: ‘I propose to
fight it out on this line, if it takes all summer.’</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of his deep-rooted determination
to crush the rebellion, Grant could show a consideration
for the feelings of his vanquished foes
that with a man of smaller calibre would have
been impossible. ‘After the surrender of General
Lee,’ Mr Thayer tells us, ‘the Union army began
to salute Grant by firing cannon. He directed
the firing to cease at once, saying: “It will wound
the feelings of our prisoners, who have become
our countrymen again.”’ It was this spirit of
consideration and conciliation that, in no small
degree, served to make union possible again
between North and South.</p>

<p>Of course, Grant did not escape calumny—what
great man ever did?—but he bore the unfounded
charges brought against him without a
murmur, silencing not a few by the contempt
with which he treated them. ‘When I have
done the best I can,’ he said once, ‘I leave it.’
But the calumnies brought against him were
as nothing to the tide of honours that burst
upon him as soon as the value of his services
became apparent. Even before the war was
ended, he was, or might have been, the best
fêted man in the Union. But his whole
nature revolted at the idea. When he was
appointed Lieutenant-general, he was ordered to
repair to Washington to receive his commission
from the President. Mrs Lincoln proposed to give
a grand military dinner in his honour. But
Grant pleaded that his presence was needed on
the field, and begged to be excused. ‘I do not
see how we <i>can</i> excuse you,’ Mrs Lincoln urged;
‘it would be Hamlet with the Prince left out.’
The reply shows the man in all the rugged
simplicity of his grand nature: ‘I appreciate
fully all the honour Mrs Lincoln would do me;
but time is precious; and really, Mr President,
I have had enough of the show business!’</p>

<p>But the ‘show business’ was only beginning;
and no sooner was the war at an end, than
honours fell thick and fast on the hero of the
long struggle. Office, wealth, and power were all
within his grasp, and at the nation’s call he took
them up, and right wisely did he use them.
Twice he served in the highest and proudest office
an American citizen can hold; and at the expiration
of his second term of office in 1876, he set
out on a long-desired trip round the world. How
he was received with more than kingly honour
the wide-world over, is within the memory of
all. His entry to a city was the signal for a burst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">{105}</span>
of enthusiastic welcome, and everywhere he was
fêted to the utmost of the people’s power. On
every hand he was met by the call for speeches,
and speech-making he thoroughly detested; yet
the few clear, concise sentences, bristling with
shrewd common-sense, and overflowing with
genuine feeling, to which he confined his remarks,
will long be remembered by those who heard
them.</p>

<p>‘Although a soldier by education and profession,’
he told the citizens of London, ‘I have
never felt any sort of fondness for war, and I
have never advocated it except as a means of
peace.’ And again, to Prince Bismarck he made
a somewhat similar remark: ‘I never went into
the army without regret, and never retired without
pleasure!’</p>

<p>Through Europe, and home by India, Siam,
China, and Japan, went the General and his
party, welcomed and fêted everywhere. The long
tour came to an end at San Francisco, on
September 20, 1879, and the journey thence to
the Eastern States was one long triumphal
progress. The General took up his residence in
New York, and though an abortive attempt was
made to secure his return for a third time to the
White House in 1880, he took little or no further
share of public life. His fortune he invested in
a business in which his son was partner with a
man named Ward, and in the downfall of this
concern, the General lost his all. With unflinching
courage, he faced the situation, conscious
though he was of the formation of that dread
cancer in the throat that in the end proved
too strong for him. Magazines were willing to
pay large prices for articles from his pen, and
publishers eager to issue his autobiography. So,
with a brave heart, the General set himself to
fight his last battle.</p>

<p>The news of his terrible position soon became
known, and a public subscription was proposed,
that would quickly have restored Grant
to more than his former wealth; but he would
have none of it. Congress, greatly to his delight,
placed him on the retired list of the army. ‘They
have brought us back our old commander,’ said
Mrs Grant when she heard the news. But it
was not for long. On the 23d of July 1885, the
battle came to an end, and ‘Unconditional
Surrender Grant’ gave in at last to the great
conqueror of all.</p>

had stopped payment! Imagine Lady Clara
Vere de Vere discovering her wonderful <i>parure</i>,
with its European renown, to be paste! Imagine
the feelings of Thomas Carlyle when the carelessness
of John Stuart Mill destroyed the labour
of years! Imagine poor Euclid’s state of mind
when his wife burnt his books! In short,
imagine, each of you, the greatest calamity you
can think of, and you will have some faint
notion of the feelings of the quartet in Mr
Carver’s office at Mr Bates’s disconcerting discovery.</p>

<p>For a few minutes, silence reigned supreme,
and then Edgar commenced to whistle. It was
not a particularly cheerful air, but it sufficed to
arouse the others from their stupefaction.</p>

<p>‘If I had not been an infatuated old idiot,’
said Mr Carver, hurling the unfortunate volume
of romance with unnecessary violence across the
room, ‘I should have foreseen this;’ and murmuring
something about strait-waistcoats and the
thick-headedness of society in general, he lapsed
into gloomy silence.</p>

<p>Mr Bates regarded his chief in mild disapproval.
Such an ebullition of feeling by no
means accorded with his views of professional
etiquette; besides, he had a feeling that his discovery
had not been treated in a proper and
business-like manner. ‘Hem!’ said that gentleman,
clearing his throat gently—‘hem! If I
may be allowed to make a remark—apologising
to you, sir’—Mr Carver nodded with dark meaning—‘and
taking upon myself to make a suggestion:
might it not be possible that where the
money is, a will may be concealed also?’</p>

<p>The party ceased to contemplate space, and a
ray of hope quivered on the gloomy horizon for
a moment. Mr Carver, however, eyed his clerk
with an air of indignation blended with resigned
sorrow. ‘I suppose, Bates, every man has moments
of incipient insanity,’ he said in accents of the
most scathing sarcasm. ‘You, I perceive, are
only mortal. I should be sorry to imagine you
to have arrived at the worst stage; but I may
be allowed, I think, to point out to you one
little fact. Do you for one moment suppose that
a man who is idiot enough to bury his treasure
in this manner, has enough sense remaining to
make a will?’ and Mr Carver looked at his
subordinate with the air of a man who has
made his great point and confounded his adversary.</p>

<p>‘I do not agree with you, sir,’ retorted Bates
mildly. ‘A gentleman who has brains enough
to carry out such a scheme as this, was not likely
to forget a vital part. You are generally sharp
enough to see a point like this. What with
romances and games of marbles, hem! and such
other frivolities, business seems quite forgotten!’</p>

<p>It was curious to note with what eagerness
the parties most interested hung upon the clerk’s
words.</p>

<p>‘Bates, Bates! I never thought it would come
to this,’ returned the pseudo-justice, shaking his
head in more sorrow than anger. ‘A man still
in the prime of life and to talk like this! Poor
fellow, poor fellow!’</p>

<p>‘Well, sir, you may doubt, and of course you
have a right to your own opinion; but we shall
see.’</p>

<p>‘See, Bates! how can we see?’ exclaimed the
lawyer. ‘Is not this treasure buried upon Miss
Wakefield’s property, and are we likely to get
an order to search that property?—O yes, of
course’—returning to the sarcastic mode—‘Miss
Wakefield is so gentle, so amiable, so sweet,
and unsuspecting!—Bates, I am ashamed of
you!’</p>

<p>The imperturbable Bates shrugged his shoulders
slightly and resumed his writing. So far as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">{106}</span>
he was concerned, the matter was done with; but
he knew the character of his superior sufficiently
to know that the words he had said would take
root, for, sooth to say, Mr Carver laid considerable
weight upon his junior’s acumen, though,
between the twain, such an idea was tacitly
ignored.</p>

<p>During the above interesting duologue, Mr
Slimm had been eyeing the antagonists with a
smile of placid amusement. That wily gentleman
was rather taken with Bates’s argument. ‘Seems
to me,’ he said, ‘the advantage is not all on
one side. The honoured mistress of Eastwood,
the lady whom our friend’—pointing to Mr
Carver—‘has spoken of in such eulogistic terms,
is no better off than we are. She has the property
where the money is concealed, and, as far
as we know now, it belongs to her. Any movement
on our side will be sufficient to arouse
her suspicions. Providing the money is found,
as I have before said, as far as we know, it
belongs to her. It is scarcely worth while going
to the trouble and expense of unearthing this
wealth for her. So far, she has the bulge on
us. On the other hand, we know where the
money is. She does not, and there we have
the bulge on her.’</p>

<p>‘And what is your proposition?’ Mr Carver
inquired.</p>

<p>‘Arbitration,’ replied the American. ‘There
is only one thing to do, and that is compromise.
Even supposing our friends only get half, surely
that is better than nothing. It’s the easiest
thing in the world. All you have to do is to
say to the lady: “Miss Wakefield, Mr Morton
left you his money. You cannot find the money.
Mrs Seaton knows where it is. The money, we
admit, is yours, though in justice it should
belong to her. In a word, my dear lady,
divide;”’ and Mr Slimm leant back in his chair
whistling a little air from <i>Princess Ida</i>, as if the
whole thing was settled to the satisfaction of
all parties.</p>

<p>Mr Carver looked at him as a connoisseur
eyes a bad copy of an old master. ‘Mr Slimm,
I presume you have never seen the lady?’</p>

<p>Mr Slimm shook his head.</p>

<p>‘I thought not,’ continued Mr Carver. ‘You
have been all over the world, and in the course
of your rambles I presume you have seen the
Sphinx?—Very good. Now, I do not suppose
it ever struck you as a good idea to interview
that curiosity, or to sit down before its stony
charms with a view to learning its past history
and the date of its birth.—No? The idea is
too absurd; but I may venture to say, without
exceeding the bounds of professional caution, that
you are just as likely to get any display of
emotion from Miss Wakefield—and indeed, the
wonderful stone is much the more pleasant
object’——</p>

<p>‘But she is not so very awful, Mr Carver,’
Eleanor interposed.</p>

<p>‘My dear, I know she is not endowed with
venomous fangs, though she has the wisdom of
the serpent. I am prepared to do anything for
you in any shape or form, but I do draw the
line at Miss Wakefield. As regards interviewing
her upon such a subject, I must respectfully but
firmly decline.’</p>

<p>‘Surely you don’t object to such a course being
taken?’ Edgar asked eagerly. ‘There is no particular
harm in it.’</p>

<p>‘On the contrary, I think it is the right course
to adopt; but I do <i>not</i> propose to be the victim,’
said Mr Carver drily. ‘If any one in this select
company has some evil to atone for, and wants
a peculiarly torturing penance, let him undertake
the task.’</p>

<p>Felix looked at Mr Bates; Edgar looked at his
wife, and each waited politely and considerately
for the others to speak. It is not often one meets
such pure disregard of self in this grasping world.
However, the task must be done; and as Mr
Carver disclaimed it, and Bates had no interest
in the affair, moreover, Eleanor not being expected
to volunteer, manifestly the work lay
before the American, Edgar, or Felix.</p>

<p>The American, like another Curtius, was prepared
to fling himself into the gulf. With characteristic
and national modesty, he merely waited,
willing to yield the van of battle; but the delicacy
of the others left him no alternative. He
volunteered to go.</p>

<p>‘I am a man of few words,’ he said, ‘and I
guess I am about calculated to fill the vacancy.
I am alone in the world, and if I fail to return,
there will be no dear one to mourn the loss.
I have one little favour to ask before I go,
and that is, in case the worst happens, to spare
me an epitaph. You will think of me sometimes;
and when you sit round your winter
firesides and the wind is howling in the naked
trees’—— Here he waved his hands deprecatingly
towards the company, as if praying them
to spare his emotions.</p>

<p>Mr Carver’s eyes twinkled at this tirade. ‘Well,
that is settled then,’ he said. ‘The sooner you
go the better. Shall we say to-morrow?—Very
good. The address is 34 Cedar Road, Hampstead.’</p>

<p>‘It is well,’ said the victim to friendship.
‘Before I quit you once and for ever, I should
like to break the bread of joviality once more;
for the last time, I should like to look upon
the wine when it is red. To drop the language
of metaphor, I invite you all to lunch with me
at the <i>Holborn</i>.’</p>

<p>It was left, then, in Mr Slimm’s hands to
consummate what he denominated as ‘working
the oracle.’</p>

<p>‘What do you think of my dream, now?’
Eleanor asked her husband as they walked home
together.</p>

<p>‘Your “Argosy with golden sails?”’ queried
Edgar. ‘Well, I am beginning to think it may
come into port after all.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Like the ‘condemned man’ of the penny-a-liner,
Mr Slimm passed a good night, and the thought
of the task he had undertaken did not deter him
from making a hearty and substantial breakfast.
Without so much as a tremor, he ordered a cab,
and sped away northwards on his diplomatic
errand.</p>

<p>Cedar Road may, without any great stretch of
imagination, be termed dingy. It is not the
dinginess of the typical London street, but a
jaunty kind of griminess, a griminess which
knows itself to be grimy, but swaggers with a
pretension of spick-and-span cleanliness; a sort
of place which makes one think of that cheap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">{107}</span>
gentility which wears gaudy apparel and unclean
linen, or no linen at all. I may better explain
my meaning by saying that the majority of the
houses were black with smoke, and yet, singularly
enough, the facings of light stone at the corners
had preserved their natural colour, and each house
was adorned by a veranda painted a staring green,
which stood out in ghastly contrast to the fog-stained
fronts. Every house had a little grass
plot—called, by a stretch of courtesy, the lawn—fronting
it. It was presumedly of grass, because
it was vegetation of some kind, but about as much
like the genuine article as London milk resembles
the original lacteal fluid. In the centre of each
‘lawn’ was an oval flower-bed, tenanted by some
hardy annuals, bearing infinitesimal blooms of a
neutral tint. Each house was approached by a
flight of steps rising from the road, which gentle
ascent served to keep the prying gaze of the
vulgar from peering too closely into the genteel
seclusion of the dining-rooms. Every house was
the counterpart of its neighbour, each having the
same sad-coloured curtains and wire-blinds on the
ground-floor, the same cheap muslins at the
drawing-room windows, and the same drawn
blinds, surmounted with brass rods, to the bedrooms.
A canary likewise hung in a painted cage
in every drawing-room window; No. 34 boasting
in addition a stagnant-looking aquarium, containing
three torpid goldfish in extremely dirty
water.</p>

<p>After three peals of the bell, each outrivalling
its predecessor in volume, which is not saying
much for the bell-metal at No. 34, Mr Slimm
was answered. Through the fragile door he had
distinctly heard the sounds of revelry within,
and acquired the information that some mystic
Melissa was ‘tidying,’ and therefore ’Tilda must
transform herself for the nonce into the slave
of the bell. By the petulant expression on
’Tilda’s face, the errand was not particularly
pleasant to her.</p>

<p>In answer to his query, the misanthropic
’Tilda vouchsafed the information that Miss
Wakefield was in, adding, that he had better
come this way; which siren summons he lost
no time in obeying, and was thus introduced
into the seclusion of Miss Wakefield’s
chamber. Inquiring his name with a snap, and
having obtained the desired information, the
bewitching ’Tilda disappeared, and apparently
appeared to be singing some sort of ditty in
a crescendo voice at the foot of the stairs; the
fact of the case being that Miss Wakefield was
summoned <i>vivâ voce</i>; her part of the conversation
being inaudible, and the voice of the charmer
being perfectly distinct to the visitor, the song
running something after this fashion: ‘Miss
Wakefield’—um, um, ‘wanted, mum’—um, um.
‘A man, please’—um, um, um. ‘Rather tall’
(very distinctly)—um. ‘No; he is not a gentleman’—um,
um, um.—‘All right, miss.’ And then
she reappeared with the information that Miss
Wakefield would be down at once.</p>

<p>The space of time mentioned having resolved
itself into a quarter of an hour, Mr Slimm was
enabled to complete his plan of campaign, not
that he anticipated any resistance—in which
deduction he was decidedly wrong—but because
he thought it best to be quite prepared with his
story, and in a position to receive the enemy in
good and compact order. By the time he had
done this, and taken a mental inventory of all
the furniture in the room—not a violent effort
of memory—the door opened, and Miss Wakefield
entered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_FEW_WORDS_ON_SALMON_ANGLING">A FEW WORDS ON SALMON ANGLING.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Salmon</span> anglers as a class are shrewd and observant;
many of them are men of education; not
a few are men of distinction in literature, science,
and art; and certainly few follow the business
of their lives with such an ardent zeal, watching
and calculating all the chances of success; yet,
strangely enough, the anglers of to-day know
little more than was known generations ago as
to the habits of the fish, and how or when they
are most likely to succeed in capturing them.
It is asserted that the salmon fly is essentially
the same lure as was used two centuries ago;
and despite the great increase of anglers and the
ready reward that awaits any improvement that
an inventor might produce, no lure has been
devised at all equal to the so-called fly; for, be
it remembered, there is no consensus of opinion
amongst anglers as to what this lure appears to
be, to the eye of the salmon. All are agreed
that it resembles no living insect, though some
hold that it must be taken for an insect, from
the opening and shutting of the wings caused by
the play of the rod; others argue that its appearance
is that of the shrimp as it moves in the
water; while some maintain that it is an unmistakable
minnow in appearance, and particularly
in its movements. Against the minnow theory
it is said: ‘Why do not salmon prefer the natural
or the artificial minnow, the latter of which even,
is so much more like the real fish?’ To this it
is argued that the motion of the fly is much more
minnow-like than either of these lures, while
the wings are closely held in minnow-like
shape in the heavy currents where salmon are
commonly found, let the rod be played as it may.
In some rivers, few salmon can be induced to
take any lure, and in many rivers the majority
of those fish never rise to a fly; but we doubt
if any man yet knows the cause thereof.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are frequent examples
of salmon rising most determinedly several times
in rapid succession, and each time giving a tug
at the fly; and there are cases, as we know personally,
in which both fly and worm hooks have
been struck into the fish’s mouth, the line broken,
and the same fish caught by the same angler a
few minutes later with a similar lure, and
brought to bank with the two severed hooks in
its mouth. Such an example shows that some
salmon feed greedily at times. It also seems to
disprove another theory advanced by many men—namely,
that salmon feed so rarely in fresh waters,
that it is only an idle freak when they rise to a
glittering moving lure. Whether there are different
breeds of salmon in our British rivers,
we do not know; but certainly there are decided
variations, some being markedly short and deep
compared with others, and some reddening and
becoming more spotted in fresh water; but
whether some kinds of fish are more ‘taking’
than others, we know nothing.</p>

<p>Salmon flies are much more carefully and
artistically ‘dressed’ now than they were in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">{108}</span>
former times. The gayest and the grayest of
birds are hunted down to supply feathers for this
purpose—gold and silver pheasants, the bustards
and jungle-cocks of India, the ostrich of Africa,
the wood-ducks of North America, the great
owls and hawks of equatorial and arctic regions,
peacocks, guinea-fowls, chanticleers and drakes
of the poultry-yard, and above all turkeys,
brown, gray, and white, often carefully bred to
colour for this particular purpose—all are made
subservient to the salmon angler’s thirst for fine
feathers. The cost of materials seems of small
account, two or three guineas being frequently
given for a fine skin of the golden pheasant.</p>

<p>Hooks, though finer made and of better steel,
are not very different in shape from those in use
some two thousand years ago, as may be seen in
those got from Pompeii, now in the museum at
Naples. But in variety of fine feathers, in silks
and wools of wondrous dyes, in gold and silver
tinsels, and in the great manipulating skill now
devoted to the production of salmon flies, there
must have been advances. Many of these lures
are jewel-like enough to be worn as bonnet and
dress ornaments by ladies of fashion; and looking
into a well-stocked angling book, one cannot but
conclude that any salmon knowing a good thing
could not fail to jump at some of the dazzling
beauties got up for the delectation of its kind.
Certainly many anglers, doting over their favourites,
feel that if they were salmon, this or that
‘grand fly’ would be irresistible. We have heard
an old enthusiast assert, as he hurried into a
favourite pool, that he had on ‘a hook this morning
that a fish canna lie below.’ And yet the
fastidiousness of the fish seems to keep pace with
the advances of the angler’s art and knowledge.
Salmon see more hooks and lines, and possibly
get to know them better; and so all the fine
rods, reels, lines, and lures do not insure even
the raising of a salmon, be the day and the river
never so promising and the angler charming never
so wisely.</p>

<p>To an outsider, it must often be a huge joke
to see a party of salmon anglers mounted cap-à-pie
with such a wealth of fishing paraphernalia—silver-mounted
rods and reels, creels of vast
dimensions, waterproof coats, wading boots and
‘breeks,’ luncheon-bags and landing-nets equally
capacious, and great telescopic-mounted gaffs of
glittering steel and brass, formidable-looking
enough to grapple a seal—marching down the glen
with their gillies in the morning; and marching
back again at night without having turned a scale
on a salmon’s back, though the fish were tumbling
about the pools like porpoises, and so plentiful,
that had Donald only thrown in the big gaff, he
could hardly have failed to hook a thumper in
hauling it back again.</p>

<p>Many anglers are prone to speak with confidence
as to what conditions of water and weather
are favourable for salmon rising, and what sorts
of flies are most suitable for these varying conditions;
but experienced anglers are least likely
to speak with assurance on such points. It is
amusing enough to hear with what perceptions
fish are credited as to coming changes of weather,
and the like; and one is apt to wonder how they
in the river know so much more of the outer
atmosphere, and ‘what fools these mortals be’ who
live in it and can tell so little. There are points
on which there is some agreement; but if laid
down as rules, it must be stated that these have so
many exceptions, that it is about as difficult for
the average man to draw reliable conclusions from
them as from ‘the weather-glass.’ Salmon rise
best to the fly when there is a little colour in the
water; when skies are clouded; when the air is
clear rather than muggy; when weather is cold
rather than warm; in a falling rather than a
rising river; where waters flow sharply; and in
comparatively shallow pools or parts thereof,
rather than in deep water. When to this it is
added that the more coloured or the rougher the
water and the larger the river, the larger and
brighter the fly that should be used, most of
what is really known is summed up, leaving
a wide field for further investigation, a field
that has been long and all but fruitlessly cultivated.</p>

<p>At times, for days together, not a salmon can
be induced to rise; another day comes in which
salmon are got ‘all along the line;’ and not an
angler can assign any reliable reason for this
change, though many of them may profess to do
so. Anglers may fish a salmon pool for hours
without getting a rise; yet at some other hour,
several salmon may be caught; but whether
the cause lies in the state of the atmosphere,
the light, or the moving of fish in the pool,
all the combined wisdom of anglers is nought
but foolishness there anent. Again, a salmon
may be got by a less skilled angler fishing
immediately behind a redoubtable fisherman;
but whether it was the particular hook that
caught the eye of the fish, its particular movement
at the moment, the accidental proximity
of the fish, or all these temptations combined,
what man can tell? It seems certain that
salmon often follow a hook or watch it from
their ‘lie’ without rising to it; and undoubtedly
at times their decision ‘to fight or flee’ is
determined by the motion of the lure at the
critical moment. Anglers often observe that
their hook is suddenly seized when the motion
of the rod was stopped, or when, after hanging
still for a few seconds, it was moved. The fly
is frequently taken when it sinks deeply from
a slack line; sometimes when in the act of
sinking, and sometimes when it is being raised
slowly, as by the winding of the reel; and at
other times when the angler, stumbling over
rough stones, accidentally jerks about his hook.
A salmon frequently rushes to the surface after
a fly that is being quickly drawn up for a
fresh cast, and others take a fly when being
dragged slowly up stream by the angler walking
along the bank. Some salmon take the
fly with a grand rush. We have seen a large
fish dash half-way across a pool, with its dorsal
cutting the water for several yards ere it seized
the swift retreating fly. Others take it slowly, as
by suction.</p>

<p>Anglers are untiring in the discussion of the
merits of their various flies—Parsons, Silver
Doctors, Sweeps, Durbar Rangers, Jock Scotts,
&amp;c. Yet salmon are frequently caught by what
most anglers would call very unlikely flies, after
declining to grapple the gayest and best. So
great is this uncertainty, that many anglers
maintain it is of little consequence what the
fly is, if it is only well presented to a salmon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">{109}</span>
when in a rising mood. Salmon have been
caught in all kinds of weather—in calm and in
thunderstorm; in rain and in brilliant sunshine;
under white and under black clouds; with winds
blowing from all points of the compass—though
south and west seem best; even at times in sharp
frosty mornings. They have been often caught
with small hooks in turbid waters, and vice
versâ. We have seen a twenty-pounder rise to
a number two trout fly so small that one might
suppose such a mite could never be tasted in
such a mouth, and yet the salmon rose to it
like a porpoise, though in a very small crystal-clear
river and under a dazzling noonday sun.
As to the play of the rod in salmon angling,
fish are taken under all fashions—fast and slow,
short or long lifting; while some successful
fishermen trust more to the current making the
play, and move their rods very slightly. We
have seen an angler kill two large salmon and
lose a third in quick succession by standing in
one spot and holding his rod quite still. One
piece of reliable good advice we can give to
those who have not already learned it. Though
an angler in a general way can form a notion
as to what are the likely parts of a river, it
is only by repeated observations that some of
the best ‘lies’ are found out; and as there are
favourite ‘lies’ occupied all the year round, and
year after year, by the finest river-trout, sea-trout,
and salmon, it is best to observe where
the anglers who have long frequented a river,
fish most persistently, as there the fish will
certainly be found.</p>

<p>Salmon anglers—unlike trout anglers—should
make few casts, should cast the line lightly,
playing the fly quietly and persistently over the
best parts of the pools only, and not wasting
time over unknown water. Nothing so certainly
diminishes his chances of a ‘rise,’ as recklessly
wading where he may be seen by the fish, or
casting his line heavily, and lifting it often and
hurriedly.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="BUTTERINE">BUTTERINE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Professor Sheldon</span>, at the great show of the
British Dairy Farmers’ Association, tried to comfort
some of those present by telling them that
there was a great future for dairy-farming in
this country. Whilst corn-growing was doomed
in England, the consumption of fresh milk was
increasing—it had trebled in London within the
last twenty years. Both cheese and butter
ought to be consumed in much greater quantities,
for there was no article of food so cheap as
cheese. He had no objection to butterine; only,
let it be sold as such.</p>

<p>At the annual meeting of the same society,
presided over by Lord Vernon, Canon Bagot
introduced the subject of butterine, the extended
use and manufacture of which is already pressing
heavily on the dairy-farmer. He said he did
not want to stop the sale of butterine; but he
wanted the law so altered, that persons should
be imprisoned, instead of being fined, for selling
butterine as butter. He gave a bit of personal
experience. He said he had disguised some of
the Dublin dairymaids and sent them to purchase
butter in eight shops. In every case, a
receipt was given to the effect that the butter
was pure; but on being analysed, it was found
that there was not a particle of butter in any
of the samples. One of these tradesmen had been
fined five times for selling butterine as butter!
A motion which he moved was carried—‘That
the Council be requested to take into consideration
the best means of prohibiting the sale of
butterine as butter, and that they immediately
take such steps as were desirable.’</p>

<p>Lord Vernon added his testimony as to the
unfairness of retailing butterine for butter and
selling it at one-and-sixpence a pound. He had
seen enormous quantities of butterine in Paris,
but there it was sold as such. About a month
previously, he had been asked by a man to
turn his dairy-farm into a butterine factory, by
which he hoped to make ten thousand pounds
a year.</p>

<p>Under the title of ‘Sham Butter,’ in
<i>Chambers’s Journal</i> for May 15, 1880, the discovery
and manufacture of butterine were briefly
related. An ingenious Frenchman, M. Mège,
patented a process by which beef-suet can be
converted into butterine, and since then the
manufacture has spread till we have factories
at work in France, England, Holland, Germany,
and America. In a Report laid before the
House of Commons, it was declared that the
substances so produced were harmless, and that
good butterine was more wholesome than bad
butter. In considering the subject, it must be
remembered that there is good and bad butterine,
as well as good and bad butter.</p>

<p>Oleo-margarine is the raw material from
which butterine is made. It is procured in this
way: From the freshly slaughtered carcasses of
cattle in the abattoirs of large towns, the superfluous
portions of suet are taken to the butterine
factories. The finest, cleanest, and sweetest portions
only are selected for making oleo-margarine.
This prepared oil is largely exported from America
to Holland, whence it comes over to us as
butterine.</p>

<p>A scientific periodical describes the process
of manufacture as follows. At the factory, the
beef-suet is thrown into tanks containing tepid
water; and after standing a short time it is washed
repeatedly in cold water, and disintegrated and
separated from fibre by passing it through a ‘meat-hasher,’
worked by steam, after which it is forced
through a fine sieve. It is then melted by surrounding
the tanks with water at a temperature
of about one hundred and twenty degrees Fahrenheit.
Great care is taken not to exceed this point;
otherwise, the fat would begin to decompose and
acquire a flavour of tallow. After being well
stirred, the adipose membrane subsides to the
bottom of the tank, and is separated under the
name of ‘scrap,’ whilst a clear yellow oil is left
above, together with a film of white oily substance.
This film is removed by skimming, and
the yellow oil is drawn off and allowed to solidify.
The ‘refined fat,’ as the substance is now termed,
is then taken to the pressroom—which is kept
at a temperature of about ninety degrees Fahrenheit—packed
in cotton cloths, and placed in galvanised
iron plates in a press. On being subjected
to pressure, oil flows away. The cakes of stearine
which remain are sent to the candle-makers.
The oil—which is now known as oleo-margarine—is
filled into barrels for sale or export, or directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">{110}</span>
made into butterine by adding to it ten per cent.
of milk and churning the mixture. It is now
coloured with annatto and rolled with ice, to set
it; salt is added; the process is finished, and it
is ready for packing.</p>

<p>Holland has taken the lead in the manufacture
of butterine; there are now forty-five factories
in the country, most of which are in North
Brabant, where the farms are small, and maintain
but one or two cows. As the farmers there
can only make a small quantity of butter, which
is apt to spoil before it can be collected for market,
they readily make contracts with the butterine-makers.
The factories at Oss, in Holland, alone,
send an average of one hundred and fifty tons
per week of oleo-margarine butter to England.
There are also several firms in this country
engaged in its manufacture; one firm in London
can turn out from ten to twenty tons per week.</p>

<p>Professor Mayer in 1883 made some experiments
as to the digestibility and wholesomeness
of butterine as compared with dairy butter. The
experiments were made on two healthy male
subjects; and the conclusion arrived at was, that
there is not much difference between the digestibility
of butterine and that of dairy butter.
As to eggs or germs existing in butterine,
whereby disease may be spread, there is as yet,
happily, no instance on record. As far as nutritive
qualities go, it stands on very nearly the
same level as butter.</p>

<p>We learn that an Act was passed, April
24, 1884, by the Senate of New York prohibiting
the fabrication of any article out of margarine
substances, intended to replace butter and cheese.
A fine of one hundred dollars is attached to the
breaking of the Act. In the preliminary inquiry
made by a Committee, it is stated that twenty
out of the thirty samples bought as dairy butter
were proved to be butterine. The quantity of
butterine manufactured and sent into the State
of New York was estimated at forty million
pounds annually. The ordinary butter, except
the very best grades, was spoken of as rapidly
disappearing from the market. One witness testified
that something between one hundred and fifty
and two hundred thousand packages of butterine,
of fifty-five pounds each, were shipped at New
York in 1882; and between two hundred and
two hundred and fifty thousand packages in 1883.
Another witness said that the gross receipts of
the genuine butter-trade in New York are fifty
per cent. less than what they would be but for
the sale of butterine as butter.</p>

<p>The passing of this Act is virtually a granting
of protection for the American dairy industry,
and gives effect to the voice of so far
interested parties. Butterine has fared much
better at the hands of scientific men. Sir Lyon
Playfair, Sir Frederick J. Bramwell, Sir F. Abel,
Dr James Bell, and others, none of whom are
in any way interested in its manufacture, have
given a favourable verdict regarding butterine,
looking upon it as a boon to the working
population. Dr James Bell, in a paper read at
the International Health Exhibition, said that
butterine and oleo-margarine are, in the opinion
of high authorities, legitimate articles of commerce,
when honestly sold, and if made in a
cleanly manner from sound fats, as they afford
the poor a cheap and useful substitute for butter,
especially during the winter months, when good
butter is both scarce and dear.</p>

<p>Professor Odling, who presided at a meeting of
the London Society of Arts, when a paper was
read by Mr Anton Jurgens, in December 1884, on
this subject, is of the same opinion. Mr Jurgens
said that the total exports from Holland alone,
in 1883, amounted to about forty thousand tons,
valued at about three million pounds sterling.
The greatest care was taken in its manufacture
to promote cleanliness and excellence. No tainted
fat could possibly be used: the smallest portion
of bad fat would contaminate the whole mass.
The <i>Lancet</i> has said that butterine is better and
cheaper than much of the common butter sold.
Mr Jurgens is of the same opinion; and he also
said that, owing to its composition, butterine does
not become rancid, but retains its sweetness longer
than butter. This was owing to the absence of
butyrin, which gives the aroma to fresh butter,
but causes it soon to become rank.</p>

<p>Dr Mouton says that the Dutch manufacturers
strongly desire to have this product imported
under its own name, and he questions whether a
single package is introduced under a false one.
Dutch butterine, when made from the best
materials, cannot easily be distinguished from
dairy butter; but when made from bad materials,
it is easily discerned, and no consumer could be
imposed upon by it. He says further, that the
English market is the most particular one with
which they have to deal. Denmark is the only
European state where particular regulations are
in force with regard to the manufacture, sale, and
import of butterine. In France, a bill for this
purpose has been drafted; in the other European
states, the import of margarine and butterine
seems to be considered as a public boon.</p>

<p>Time, which tests all things, will also test butterine.
Professor Odling, speaking as a physician,
says that a cheap and inexpensive fat is
a great want with many young children, and
that butterine supplies this want. We find
that butterine can be sold at a profit, for
the different qualities, at from eightpence to
one-and-fourpence per pound. When, as we have
already seen, it is made from good materials, it is
wholesome and nourishing; and considering the
demands of our vast population in this respect—our
imports of butter and butterine last year
amounting in value to twelve and a half millions
sterling—who shall say that butterine may not
have a useful future before it? Let it, however,
be <i>called</i> butterine, and honestly sold as such.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THAT_FATAL_DIAMOND">THAT FATAL DIAMOND.</h2>
</div>
<p class="ph3">A THIEF’S CONFESSION.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> the most unhappy man that ever occupied
a prison cell. I say this advisedly, knowing that
hundreds are at this moment bewailing their fate,
which in many cases may seem harder than mine;
but it is not, if they still retain the self-respect
which I have lost. That’s what tortures me;
my <i>prestige</i> is gone; I am degraded in my own
eyes; I despise myself as heartily as the most
virtuous man in the world could. That I, to
whom half the thieves in London have looked
for guidance, should myself have laid a plot for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">{111}</span>
myself and walked into it! It is too humiliating!
To fall a victim to a too powerful combination
of adverse circumstances is no disgrace; to be
outwitted by the superior finesse of the police is
hard, but endurable; but to fall into a snare which
should not have misled a boy who had never
stolen so much as a handkerchief in his life—this,
this is shame!</p>

<p>It was that diamond ring that did it. I really
think some special ill-luck must have attached to
the trinket, for it brought no good to its previous
possessor. It was hardly in the regular way of
business that it came into my hands—just as it
has escaped from them in a most unbusiness-like
fashion. That young man must have been in
great straits before he united himself to me in the
business of stealing his uncle’s cash-box, in order
to obtain funds to pay his gambling debts. It
was a very easy matter for me. He was to mix
a few drops of an opiate I gave him with his
relative’s brandy-and-water one evening, and leave
the hall-door open; I had only to walk in and
take up the booty he had collected and placed
ready for me. It was a very fair collection of
plate that awaited me as well as the coveted cash-box;
but I am fond of jewellery, and the house
was so beautifully asleep, that I could not resist
creeping up to the master’s bedroom to see if there
was not in it a trifle worth picking up. There
was—the diamond ring, and a rather good set of
studs. I took them, and slipped out of the room
so quietly that I should not have disturbed their
owner, even if my young friend had not, by way
of making sure, doubled the prescribed dose of
the opiate, and thereby plunged his uncle into,
not sleep, but death. Poor young fellow! the
knowledge that he had killed a relation who had
always treated him with kindness, if also with
severity, was too much for his mind, which
doubtless was never strong. Those debts of
honour were never paid; he never came to claim
his share of that night’s spoil; and I have heard
that the distant cousin who, failing him, inherited
the old man’s property, grumbles greatly at
having to pay for his being kept in a lunatic
asylum.</p>

<p>This is cowardice on my part. I have condemned
myself, as the fitting punishment of
my folly, to set down in black and white the
way in which I entrapped myself, and I am postponing
the task to maunder over an irrelevant
incident.</p>

<p>The ring had not been long in my possession
when I paid the unlucky visit to Paris which
began my misfortunes. The London police were
very active just then, and business was in consequence
dull and risky, so, being in funds, I
thought I might take a holiday and enjoy a
fortnight in the city of pleasure. I was pretty
well known at home; but I had not, so far as
I knew, a single enemy in France, and I did not
intend to make any. For a fortnight I would be
a mere innocent pleasure-seeker, taking the day’s
amusements as they came, and making no effort
after either my own gain or others’ loss. Such
was my intention; but alas! what intention,
especially if it be a good one, can withstand the
force of the habits of a lifetime? Mine gave way,
and speedily.</p>

<p>One evening, a pleasant April evening, I
formed one of the crowd that surrounded the
platform at an open-air concert. By my side was
standing a stout and elderly man, whom, from a
score of tiny indications, I guessed to be a British
holiday-maker. ‘There’s from fifteen to twenty
pounds in his coat-pocket, I’ll be bound,’
thought I. ‘He is far too cautious to leave his
money at his hotel, where Frenchmen, whom he
regards as all thieves, may lay hands on it, so he
carries it about with him, thinking that on his
person it cannot fail to be safe.’ The idea of
undeceiving him in this particular was too tempting;
I found myself smiling in anticipation at
the bewildered and horror-struck expression his
face would wear when he discovered his loss. It
was the humour of the thing that touched me.
That fatal gift of humour, which has ruined so
many honest men, led me to my destruction.
Deep in my soul, beneath the outer garb of the
man of the world I was wearing, dwelt the
instincts of the professional pickpocket. Almost
unconsciously I inserted my left hand (we are all
ambidexter in our profession) in his pocket and
gently drew out a pocket-book—the very sort of
pocket-book I knew he would carry. I edged
away from my victim as soon as the little operation
was over, and disentangling myself from the
interested auditors who were listening to a gaily-dressed
damsel shrieking with the remains of a
once powerful voice, I soon found myself walking
along the brightly lighted boulevard. I had
not gone far before I noticed that the diamond
ring which I constantly wore on the third finger
of my left hand, was missing. It was a little
too large for me; but I had not thought it advisable
to have the size altered just yet; and
the result was that it had slipped from my finger.
I knew that I wore it when I left my hotel; but I
could not recollect noticing its presence at any
subsequent time; so I went to every place I had
visited since I came out, the café where I had
dined, the shop where I had bought some cigars,
the streets I had traversed, looking everywhere for
some trace of my lost jewel, and inquiring of every
one to whom I had previously spoken if they had
seen anything of it. I felt a dreary conviction
that my treasured ornament was gone for ever,
when, as a last resource, I went to a <i>bureau de
police</i>, and gave a description of the lost ring to
the officer there. The officer was polite, but gave
me small hope of ever seeing my diamond again.
I gave it up as gone for ever.</p>

<p>I was sitting in my hotel dull and depressed,
angry at my own carelessness, and inclined to
give up any further holiday, and forget my
annoyance by a speedy return to my professional
duties in London, when my friend of the police-office
entered.</p>

<p>‘I am happy,’ he said, bowing politely and
smiling with, as I thought, anticipation of a
handsome reward—‘I am happy to inform monsieur
that we hope soon to place his ring in
his hands. One answering to the description
you gave was brought to our office by the finder,
a countryman of your own. The ring being
rather an uncommon one, I felt assured that it
could be no other than the one you had
lost. You described it, I think, as consisting of
five diamonds set in the shape of a violet, with
a smaller brilliant in the centre—a very curious
and valuable jewel.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, that’s it,’ I replied curtly, wondering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">{112}</span>
why he could not give me back my property
without so many words.</p>

<p>‘Then I may safely assume that this is the
ring in question?’ He brought out my ring from
his pocket and showed it to me.</p>

<p>‘It is,’ I said, stretching out my hand; but he
did not restore the jewel, only stood there,
holding it and smiling more than ever. I supposed
that he wanted to see some sign of the
reward he expected to receive before parting with
the trinket. I took out my purse, and opening
it, made some remark about showing my appreciation
of his honesty; but he shook his head,
smiling, if possible, more broadly than before.</p>

<p>‘Do you not wish to know, monsieur, how your
ring was found?’ he asked, with a leer which I
thought was disagreeable.</p>

<p>‘Well, how was it found?’ I said tartly.</p>

<p>My policeman drew himself up to deliver his
great effect. ‘Monsieur, your ring was found
in another man’s pocket!’ I stared at him in
bewilderment, mingled with an indefinite fear,
while he continued his narrative in a less
courteous and more confidential tone than he
had hitherto assumed. ‘Ah! <i>mon ami</i>, one may
be too clever; one’s dexterity may lead one astray
if it be not balanced by discretion. You had not
long left the office, when another Englishman
came in complaining that he had lost a pocket-book
containing all his money. He had put his
hand in his pocket to bring it out, meaning to
pay for something, but found it gone, and in its
place a diamond ring—your ring. For my own
part, I do not doubt your honesty—even your
generosity. You believed, doubtless, that exchange
is not robbery, and that, in leaving your
ring in exchange for his <i>porte-monnaie</i>, you would
at once obtain a memento of a compatriot and
do him a practical benefit. That is the interpretation
I should wish to put on the affair; but
the owner of the pocket-book will not see it in
that light—he lacks imagination, as so many
English do. Of course, your coming to ask us to
try to recover your lost ring tends to give
colour to his version of the matter, which is, that
while you were robbing him of his money, the
ring slipped from your hand, and remained in
his pocket; and with a lack of sympathy for a
countryman, which I grieve to recount, he
demands that you should be arrested, a duty
which I am reluctantly compelled to fulfil.’</p>

<p>I was absolutely dumb with surprise and anger.
Had I had my wits about me, I might—though
circumstances were against me—have brought
some counter-charge of theft against my accuser;
but I was so stupefied by the strange turn
events had taken, that I submitted meekly to
be searched, to have the fateful pocket-book
taken from me, and to be led away to prison.
Somehow, too, I was unable to secure possession
of the ring that was the cause of my undoing,
and I have not seen it since my arrest.</p>

<p>So here I sit in my cell, depressed and weary,
a victim to the bitterest self-reproach. I could
almost wish to be condemned to lifelong imprisonment,
for what is freedom worth to me?
After such a piece of suicidal folly as I have
been guilty of, I shall never dare to lift up my
head among my professional brethren, and I fear
that nothing will be left for me but to take to
honesty when my term expires.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak smaller" id="FISH-CULTURE">FISH-CULTURE.</h2>
</div>


<p>Elaborate arrangements have been made at the
establishments of the National Fish-culture Association
for hatching the ova of all kinds of fish
this year. For some time past, agents have been
employed in spawning fish and collecting the eggs
from various rivers and streams, and a considerable
number have already been deposited in the
Hatchery at South Kensington for incubation.
The American government have intimated their
intention to forward very large consignments
of ova from the various species of salmonidæ
abounding in the waters of the United States,
including the white-fish (<i>Coregonus albus</i>), which,
owing to the success attending their propagation
in this country during 1885, will be hatched out
in large numbers. As soon as the fry are in a fit
condition, they will be located in the waters at
the Delaford Park Establishment, belonging to
the Association, whence they will be distributed
in Scottish and other lakes. It is intended by
the Association to increase the range of their
operations, and bestow further attention upon the
culture of ‘coarse’ fish, which will necessitate an
extension of the Fishery at Delaford. In 1885
numerous presentations of salmonidæ were made
to public waters in the United Kingdom, but
only those fish were selected that are desirable for
the purposes of replenishing depleted <i>locales</i>. The
various fish, both American and English, reared
at the beginning of last year by the Association
are thriving well, and it can be fairly said that
great success has crowned all the endeavours put
forward to increase the numerical proportions of
our fish and improve their multifarious species.</p>
